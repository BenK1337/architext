# ✨ **Architext AI - Project Hub** ✨

*AI Planning app designed to provide a reliable "context foundation" for AI-driven development by integrating AI-generated documentation with automatic task breakdown.*

## 🌟 Vision Statement
Architext AI aims to be the most developer-friendly, AI-powered project planning tool. Our vision is to eliminate friction and ambiguity in early-stage software planning, enabling solo devs and teams to go from idea to actionable implementation with clarity, speed, and confidence. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI and a best-in-class user experience, we make context loss a thing of the past.
