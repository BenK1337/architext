# **🧭 Architext AI - Project Overview & Documentation Index**

## **🎯 Project Goal**

Architext AI helps developers and teams translate project ideas into structured plans (PRDs, tech stacks, data models, tasks, etc.) using AI. The core purpose is to provide a clear, persistent context foundation to improve the effectiveness of both human developers and AI coding assistants, mitigating context loss in complex projects.

**A primary objective for the MVP is to closely replicate the user interface and user experience of Google's Agentspace ([cloud.google.com/products/agentspace](https://cloud.google.com/products/agentspace)) / AI Studio ([aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/)).** This includes careful attention to visual details, component behavior, and interaction patterns, drawing inspiration also from the broader Google AI ecosystem ([ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/)).

## **🌟 Vision Statement**
Architext AI aims to be the most developer-friendly, AI-powered project planning tool. Our vision is to eliminate friction and ambiguity in early-stage software planning, enabling solo devs and teams to go from idea to actionable implementation with clarity, speed, and confidence. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI and a best-in-class user experience, we make context loss a thing of the past.
