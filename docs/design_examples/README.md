## How to Use
- Use the PNGs to match static layout, spacing, color, and typography.
- Use GIFs/videos to replicate animations, transitions, and feedback.
- Reference these assets alongside `/docs/02-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for pixel-perfect implementation.

**Tip:**
If you add new design assets, update this README with a description for each new file.
